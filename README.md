### Description of business idea

The business idea is to create a platform that not only provides information about people and their hobbies but also offers a matchmaking service. Users can input their hobbies and interests, and the platform can connect them with like-minded individuals or groups in their local area. This would add a social networking element to the service and encourage people to explore new hobbies together, fostering real-world connections.

### Project Management

We have primarly used Github for most of our sharing of code and Project management.
We use Github Projects to manage our assignments and what we are missing. We met every day at 10:00 to discuss our progress and help eachother with the problems we encountered.
Since we only had 4 days from start to finish, we spend a lot of the time on fixing problems with the code and less time on proper preparation of our product and time schedule.
Discord was our main form of communication.
